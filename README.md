# linux-setup (last update: 21 June 2023)
A set of scripts to install and configure system and apps for supported Linux OSs. Ideally, each OS will be on its own branch with commonly used files present at the root of the repository. Currently a rather confusing mix of Debian, Rocky, and Fedora exists on the main branch. If I have time and remember to do so, this will be remedied eventually.

The only Linux distro that currently follows this new plan is Pop! OS on the `pop-os` branch.
